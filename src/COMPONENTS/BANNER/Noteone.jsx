		<h2>Can we detect Heart Failure?</h2>
		<p>
		Yes, heart failure can be detected using various medical and technological methods, including clinical assessments, imaging techniques like echocardiography and MRI, and biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Machine learning and AI-driven models are also being used to analyze patient data, predict heart failure risk, and provide early warnings based on parameters like ECG patterns, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors. Early detection is crucial as it allows timely interventions, lifestyle modifications, and medical treatments to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.</p>

	<h2>Factors that are causing Heart Attack?</h2>
	<p>Heart attacks are caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic stress also contribute to heart disease by damaging arteries and increasing plaque buildup. Genetic predisposition and age are significant risk factors, while conditions like atherosclerosis and blood clots can directly trigger heart attacks. Managing these risks through a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, and medical check-ups can significantly reduce the chances of heart disease.</p>
